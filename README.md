- Assignment on signal processing

- There are 7 questions given in `Assignment1.pdf`

- Run the following codes in MATLAB-
  - `q1.m` - Uses Nearest Neighbour interpolation to resize an image
  - `bil_q1.m` - Uses Bilinear interpolation to resize an image
  - `q2.m` - Convolve image with edge-detection filter (Sobel operator)
  - `q4.m` - Contains code to subsample the audio in 'myRecording.wav'. Also convolves your recording with impulse responses of various environments (Eg. Church)
  - `q4_generateAudioFile.m` - Record your own voice and store in 'myRecording.wav'
  - `q5.m` - Explores different cases of edge detection filter
  - `q6.m` - Face Detection (Uses correlation to find a paticular matching face amongst a group of faces)
  - `q7.m` - Finds convolution filter given input and output signal

- Theoretical solutions are in 'Report.pdf'
